# LJ Code 201 - Day 8

<p>Common error we run into in javascript: searching for a document.getElementByID will return null if we have a typo.</p>

<p>Prototype is a property of an object, and is itself an object. It chains/links properties (often functions) to an object constructor.</p>

<p>Events are a big deal in javascript. <ul>**Javascript Events!**<li>key up</li><li>key down</li><li>submit</li><li>mouseenter</li></ul></p>

<p>In Javascript events, The listener "listens" for an event to happen. The event handler runs code when the event does happen.<p>

<p>Node is the basis of what we will learn in 401. It's an environment that allows us to write javascript on the server side (back end). The browser is the envirionment on the front end. Node lets us build servers using javascript.</p>

<p>Jquery is considered a library. It's the most widely used front-end library on the planet. Angular JS is google's project - it's a front-end library..er, framework? (very similar things on front end) as well. We're up to Angular 2 but it's brand new.</p>

<p>What is a library? Basically it's a big collection of mostly functions and methods on objects that you input to give you more tools before you start working on your own code.</p>

<p>What is a server? It's something that takes in requests and sends back responses -- at its most basic. Working with them is complicated, but what they are and what they do is very simple at its most basic. Example: When you enter and send a url it connects to a server which then sends back the web page.</p>
