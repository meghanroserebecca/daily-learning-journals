# LJ Code 201 - Day 4

<p>*If* code needs to run *multiple times*, it needs a loop!</p>

<p>Does the code need to do something *different* depending on input to variables? We need a *conditional*. If/else or switch.</p>

<p>Does your code need to represent multiples of something? You probably need an *array*. Checking a value (e.g., user input) against the contents of an array will require a loop.</p>

<p>If you need to keep track (e.g., tally a total number of correct answers) you need to declare a global variable at the top.</p>

<p>Try to think not in terms of loops and conditionals etc., but what they actually represent to the user! While loops are often ASKING A QUESTION MULTIPE TIMES.</p>

<p>Most break statements will be behind if/else conditionals.</p>

<p>**CSS NOTES**</p>

<p>The "display" property is CSS's most important property for controlling layout. Every element has a default display value depending on what type of element it is.</p>

<p>The default for most elements is usually **block** or **inline** - a block element is often called a block-level element. An inline element is always just called an inline element.</p>

<p>By default, every block element stretches across the entire page.</p>

<p><span> is the standard inline element. An inline element can wrap some text inside a paragraph <span>like this</span></p>

<p>A really common use of inline elements is for Navs.</p>

<p>**What is a Function?**
A function is a piece of code that can be set once and called over and over and over again.<br />

example: *function* **myFirstFunction**() { <br />
  *code to be executed*<br />
}**</p>
