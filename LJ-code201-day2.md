# LJ Code 201 - Day 1
<p>Today we worked on evaluating conditions and making conditional statements using if/else in javascript. We also combined js html & css files in this project, giving us a taste for how they all work together.<br />
My project ran through the script from the battle of wits scene in the princess bride, prompting users to respond to variants of vizzini's and westley's questions and giving alert responses based on input.</p>
<p>We also worked on Branching</p>
<p>Branching! 'Origin' is your default main remote, and 'master' is your default main branch of your repository.<br />
Basic git Workflow: modify, add, commit.<br />
Imagine your repo is code for a vital website.<br />
Further imagine that your production server is running using code on the master branch.<br />
We don't want changes made willy-nilly to that master branch. We only want tested, vetted code to end up in master<br />.
So we ask dev teams to implement fixes & features on branches.</p>

<p>ALWAYS branch off of MASTER!!!</p>

<p>Git command: checkout<br />
It has 2 uses: the first takes a branch name as an argument and moves you to that branch (timeline)<br />
git checkout [branch name] takes you to another (preexisting) branch. <br />
git checkout -b [new branch name] both creates and moves you to a new branch. <br />
</p>

<p>Pushing Different branches<br />
In order to push this new branch to GitHub we need to clarify in the push command that we are pushing origin [name of new branch]</p>

<p>Pull Requests allow us to work together all over the world.</p>

Today we learned the basics of merging CSS, HTML and JS files. It has been fun!
