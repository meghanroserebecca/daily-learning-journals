# LJ Code 201 - Day 7

<p>"this" (e.g. this.somePropertyInsideAnObject) can only be used inside of methods. do not use with variables.</p>

<p>Everything to the right of an equals sign evaluates BEFORE the left hand side (since it is the right hand side giving a value to the left). So if you have an object called anObject, you can't use the object's name itself to define its properties.</p>

<p>When doing DOM manipulation, if creating a list, you have to make a new node for each individual list item. so you have to make an li and an li2 and an li3 etc.</p>
